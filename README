This fork of libshout 2.2.2 adds support for specifying arbitrary MIME types via shout_set_mime().

This makes it possible to send AAC-encoded audio using a MIME type of "audio/aac" and shout_send_raw().

Based on the patch by Randy: http://djlab.com/2010/05/arbitrary-mime-support-for-aacplus-streaming-with-libshout-and-perl-bindings/

libshout
--------

Libshout is a library for communicating with and sending data to an
icecast server.  It handles the socket connection, the timing of the
data, and prevents bad data from getting to the icecast server.

With just a few lines of code, a programmer can easily turn any application
into a streaming source for an icecast server.  Libshout also allows 
developers who want a specific feature set (database access, request taking)
to concentrate on that feature set, instead of worrying about how server
communication works.

Please refer to the api reference and example code to start learning how to 
use libshout in your own code.

Libshout is licensed under the LGPL.  Please see the COPYING file for details.
