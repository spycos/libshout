libshout (2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sponsored upload on behalf of keegan (splendid packaging - looking

  * Keep Maintainer field, but add myself as uploader.
  * Bump up standards-version to 3.6.0 (no changes needed).

    cross-compiling on same arch (as recommended by autotools-dev
    README-Debian).
  * Include shout.m4 and example.c in -dev package.

libshout (1.9+2.0alphacvs030704-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

    of the 'pristine' tarball from CVS.  This doesn't really effect the
    contents of the package, just makes it easier for me to rebuild.
  * New CVS source.
  * Included /usr/lib/pkgconfig/shout.pc for pkg-config support, newly
    added upstream.
